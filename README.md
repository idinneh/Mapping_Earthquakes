# Mapping_Earthquakes

## The Purpose of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitude of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. The JavaScript and the D3.js library was used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data. At the end, we where able to show the tectonic plates and the major earthquakes across the world. The map was made visually appealing by adding different layers to provide options in viewing the map.
